<br/>
Minimal, simple and beautiful alarm clock thoughtfully designed by nap enthusiasts.
<br/>
Crafted by a team with over 25 years of sleeping experience - it just has to be the best!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It does only one function but does it well. Only one alarm time is supported and it can be set to recur daily. 
Setting the new alarm time takes less than a second. To dismiss the alarm simply hold down anywhere on the screen. 
There is no snooze mode because you should be honest to yourself: if it's time to wake up - go ahead!
